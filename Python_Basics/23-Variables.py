# Variables Best Practices

#1 -> snake_case
#2 -> start with lowercase or underscore
#3 -> variables are case sensitive
#4 -> don't overwrite keywords

iq = 190
user_age = iq / 3
a = user_age

print(a)

# Use all capitals for constants
PI = 3.1415

# Careful with Dunders (double unders)
# Dont create variables starting with two underscores

# Multiple variable assignations at once
a,b,c = 1,2,3
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
